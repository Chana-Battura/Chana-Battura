## More About Me Beyond Programming:

When I am not working programming classes and internships, I am often playing sports like tennis and basketball, watching shows and movies (One Piece, Severance, Solo Leveling, Invincible), or playing video games.  I am more of a story-game player having recently completed Elden Ring and Red Dead Redemption 2, I have been also been into Pokemon and other games like this.  Beyond all this, when I am home, I'm often walking or talking pictures of my dog Tommy (a German Shepherd/Border Collie/Shark mix ðŸ˜†) so here are a few of his pictures:
